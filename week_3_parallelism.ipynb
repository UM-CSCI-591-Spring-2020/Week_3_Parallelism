The computeMinibatchGradientsTuple() function is the same as the computeMinibatchGradients() function, but its inputs in a single tuple will make using Python's ThreadPool easier later on.\n",

    "Now that we have some baseline timings, we're going to be updating this example to employ data parallelism. The Ben-Nun et.al. paper mainly focuses on parallelism in a distributed computing environment, but using a library like MPI for distributed parallelism would be well outside the scope of these assignments, so we're going to using Python's multiprocessing package to perform data parallelism with a ThreadPool\n",

    "https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing\n",

    "We're going to be using the Pool's faster (and less documented) cousin, the ThreadPool. The Pool and ThreadPool have the same interface, but while Pool uses a single thread, trading it between the pool's workers, the ThreadPool actually spins up multiple instances of the Python interpreter in different threads to perform true parallel computation.\n",

    "We will need to average the gradients returned from each parallel batch in order to perform gradient descent, but the thread pool returns a list of the list of each batch's gradients. To make averaging the gradients easier, line 58 uses the zip function to make a new list such that the first element in the list contains all the W1 gradients, the second element contains all the W2 gradients, etc. On lines 59-62, use the np.mean function to average all W1, W2, b1, and b2 gradients, and use those averages to update W1, W2, b1, and b2.\n"
